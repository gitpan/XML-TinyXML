- complete documentation
- support different encodings when importing/exporting data
- write a more exhaustive example.pl
- implement XPath unabbreviated syntax
- in TinyXML::getNode() return an array of nodes instead of the first one when
  multiple nodes match a given 'path'
- handle doctype and let user define it at object construction
- handle nested arrayrefs in the hashref <-> xml conversion
- optionally use attributes in hashref <-> xml conversion (as in XML::Simple)
- make wiping of whitespaces an optional feature
- add the possibility to output a raw xml which doesn't include extra \t and \n
  actually used to preserve readability of the created xml document
- handle !ENTITY and !ATTLIST 
- expose a event-based api since it could be easily implemented using 
  the cnode member in the TXml struct
