Revision history for Perl extension TinyXML.

0.01  Fri May 23 00:39:52 2008
      - original version; created by h2xs 1.23 with options
        -Oxan TinyXML linklist.h txml.h
0.02  - switching from flock to ftrylockfile/funlockfile 
        to ensure solaris compatibility
0.03  - make the module to build properly on windows
        (strtok_r doesn't exist on win32)
      - added some documentation (more is still needed)
0.04  - allow the module to be built and used by perl interpreters < 5.8.8
      - some more documentation regarding the XML::TinyXML::Node object
0.05  - updated documentation and implemented XML::TinyXML::addChildNode()
0.06  - bugfix: typo in XML::TinyXML::Node.pm:109
0.07  - correctly handle escaping/unescaping of xml special chars on 
        import/export operations
0.08  - bugfix : dexml() now works properly so special characters are now
        handled correctly when importing xml data
      - testunits now include escaping/unescaping-related checks
0.09  - bugfix : xmlize() MUST ensure to null-terminate the escaped string
        if the buffer had to be realloc'd
0.10  - forcing prerequisite for perl >= 5.8
      - introducing XmlGetAttributeByName() in the underlying C implementation
      - fixed direct dumping on a file: XmlSave() dumped on a file only if it
        already existed (blindly trying to create a backup copy). It now 
        creates the file if not there (and backup it if already present)
0.11  - fixed leaks in underlying XmlGetNode() and XmlSetNodePath()
      - safety belt in XmlDumpBranch() to avoid accessing invalid memory
        in some edge cases
0.12  - small improvements to the API (no changes...only extensions)
      - more testunits (and started rearranging them in multiple files)
      - by default, on export, empty nodes will use the shorter <node/> notation
        (this should be made optionally deactivable through some flag,
         as for defining encoding, whitespace handling and any other 
         optional behaviour which makes sense to take into account when 
         exporting)
0.13  - switched to macro-based linklist implementation
