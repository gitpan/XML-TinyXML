Revision history for Perl extension TinyXML.

0.01  Fri May 23 00:39:52 2008
      - original version; created by h2xs 1.23 with options
        -Oxan TinyXML linklist.h txml.h
0.02  - switching from flock to ftrylockfile/funlockfile 
        to ensure solaris compatibility
0.03  - make the module to build properly on windows
        (strtok_r doesn't exist on win32)
      - added some documentation (more is still needed)
0.04  - allow the module to be built and used by perl interpreters < 5.8.8
      - some more documentation regarding the XML::TinyXML::Node object
0.05  - updated documentation and implemented XML::TinyXML::addChildNode()
0.06  - bugfix: typo in XML::TinyXML::Node.pm:109
0.07  - correctly handle escaping/unescaping of xml special chars on 
        import/export operations
0.08  - bugfix : dexml() now works properly so special characters are now
        handled correctly when importing xml data
      - testunits now include escaping/unescaping-related checks
0.09  - bugfix : xmlize() MUST ensure to null-terminate the escaped string
        if the buffer had to be realloc'd
0.10  - forcing prerequisite for perl >= 5.8
      - introducing XmlGetAttributeByName() in the underlying C implementation
      - fixed direct dumping on a file: XmlSave() dumped on a file only if it
        already existed (blindly trying to create a backup copy). It now 
        creates the file if not there (and backup it if already present)
0.11  - fixed leaks in underlying XmlGetNode() and XmlSetNodePath()
      - safety belt in XmlDumpBranch() to avoid accessing invalid memory
        in some edge cases
